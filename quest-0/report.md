## Summary

In this quest we learned how to create a branch for a feature of our project.
On the feature branch we each created our own branch so we can work independently.
Once we completed our respective work for that feature we merged our own branch to
the feature branch. Also, the merges were done sequentially so we don't overwrite 
each other's changes. Finally when all the feature branches are finishes we merged
the feature branches into the master.
